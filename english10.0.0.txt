In many programs or programming languages that can make API requests, validating an SSL certificate is often as easy as setting a flag. For example, "

"

Statistical analysis packages can provide much more robust and precise calculation methods, and can handle a wider variety of calculation functions than can REDCap.

This is sometimes called one-to-many data collection, in which a project can have one or more repeating parts. For example, if each record in a hypothetical project represents a person, then one might have a repeating instrument for medications, one for family members, one or adverse events, and one for collecting data over multiple visits (or weekly surveys), so that each repeating element is connected to the overall record but can repeat independently of the other instruments. So if using repeating instruments or repeating events, each record in the project can have a different number of repeated instances of any given instrument or event. One record may have five medications, but another may have two or none, for example. Such flexibility makes this feature very powerful, and setting up repeating instruments and/or repeating events in a project is very quick and easy. The repeating instruments/events feature can be enabled and set up by clicking the Enable button in the Optional Modules section on the Project Setup page."

However, with the repeating instruments functionality, one does not need to specify how many repetitions will needed ahead of time; one can simply repeat an instrument an unlimited amount of times. It is important to note that multiple instruments in a project can be enabled as repeating instruments (even all of them, if one wishes). Projects utilizing the longitudinal module can have repeating instruments as well, in which one or more instruments on any defined event can be set to repeat within that event. The repeating instruments functionality behaves very much the same way in both classic and longitudinal projects."

data_entry_307 = "If a project has the longitudinal module enabled, it can utilize the repeating events feature, which works somewhat differently than the repeating instruments feature. While the repeating instruments feature allows one to repeat a given instrument as a single unit, the repeating events feature allows one to repeat an entire event of instruments together in unison. This might be useful if one has several instruments whose data correlates together, such as completing multiple surveys back to back for a specific time-point or visit, for example. Previously, one may have had to create X number of identical events to capture repeating data for the instruments on those events (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, ...), but the repeating events feature makes this much simpler by allowing one to create only one single event that can be repeated in unlimited fashion."

So it is one additional step to do after enabling the instrument itself as a repeating instrument. When the repeat survey setting is enabled, it will display a button at the end of the survey so that the respondent can choose to enter another response for the survey, thus essentially allowing them to take the survey multiple times in a row. In this way, they will be able to enter as many responses for that same survey as they need. For example, if a REDCap project is aimed at mothers, and the repeating survey is for collecting data about each of the mother's children, the mother could complete the survey once for each child, thus allowing mothers with one child or six children to easily enter their data in a quick back-to-back fashion by repeating the survey.

And if the report contains data specifically from a repeating instrument (as opposed to a repeating event), then a field named 'redcap_repeat_instrument' will additionally be included that represents the instrument name that denotes to which instrument the row of data belongs. These two fields will only be included automatically in the report or data export if data originates from a repeating instrument or event.

If the user entered 'John' as their first name, then text for the next question would literally read as <b>'John, what is your date of birth?'</b>.

If you are referencing a specific repeating instance of the field, you append (not prepend) the repeat instance number in brackets - e.g., [variable][2], in which the format is the same for both repeating instruments and repeating events. If you are referencing the second instance of a repeating event, for example, you would use the format [event][variable][2]. If you are wanting to determine if a certain option for a checkbox field is checked or not, you may include the checkbox option value inside parentheses which follow the variable name inside the brackets - e.g., [my_checkbox(4)].

Embedding fields gives you greater control over the look and feel of your instrument. For example, you may place fields in a grid/table for a more compact user-friendly page, or you can position some fields close together in a group if they are related. See the screenshots below for examples of what field embedding looks like and how to utilize this powerful feature."

It is recommended to add a Field Label even if the field is being embedded because the label will still be needed when viewing a report."

If the field is multiple choice, it will auto load all of that field's choices in a drop-down so that you may choose one of the choices. Otherwise, if it is not a multiple choice field, it will instead provide a text box for entering the filter value."
report_builder_121 = "Using ANDs and ORs with multiple fields allow you to do more complex filtering. If you have two filters with an AND between them, for example, that means that it will apply both of them together when filtering, but if you use OR, it will return results that apply to just one or the other. In general, using AND will often constrict the results further by returning less data in the report than when using OR."
report_builder_122 = "There is no limit to how many times you may use a field as a filter in a single report. TIP: If you want to find instances in your data where a field's value is blank/null, then just leave the value text box blank. Conversely, to find instances where the field has a value (i.e., is non-blank), set the operator as 'not =' with a blank text box."
report_builder_123 = "If you have filtering that uses both OR and AND, it is very important to know the order in which REDCap evaluates the ORs and ANDs to ensure that your logic behaves how you expect. Essentially, all the ORs are evaluated for consecutive filter fields as a group, and all the groups are then evaluated as ANDs with each other. For example, it looks like (this OR this OR this) AND (this OR this OR this), in which all the ORs inside the parentheses are evaluated first and then those groups of ORs are then evaluated together using ANDs."
report_builder_124 = "If you wish to do even more complex filtering, you may choose to switch the filtering format over to the 'Advanced Logic', which allows you to hand-type the filtering logic in a big text box. The filter logic is essentially the same kind of syntax as Branching Logic and Calculated field equations, in which you may use all the special functions, such as if(), datediff(), and various mathematical functions, in your filtering logic. REDCap will double check your hand-typed logic for any syntax errors, and it will not allow you to save the report until all errors have been resolved. When using the Advanced Logic, just make sure that your logic ultimately evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE and that it does *not* evaluate to a value, such as a number. For example, datediff([dob], 'today', 'y') is not valid because it will evaluate to a number, but datediff([dob], 'today', 'y') > 30 is valid because it will evaluate as either TRUE or FALSE."

report_builder_134 = "Employing user access controls for a report allows certain users to have the report appear on their left-hand project menu (below the Applications list) and thus allows the report to stay hidden and inaccessible for other users. Please note that any user that has 'Add/Edit Reports' user privileges will be able to view *all* reports in the project. This does not cause any user rights conflictions because reports do not give users access to any data to which they do not already have access. In other words, if a user was not given form-level access to a particular data collection instrument, then they will still not be able to view data from that instrument inside any report. The same goes if the user is assigned to a Data Access Group, in which case they will still only be able to view data from records in their own DAG. So even though a user may have 'Add/Edit Reports' privileges and may thus be able to view reports to which they have not been given explicit access, they will not be able to view data to which they do not already have access. So implementing user access for a report is not quite the same as setting someone's user privileges. Reports merely act as a window, so to speak, for viewing a subset of the data to which a user has access, in which user privileges are employed when viewing a report. But user access controls for a report merely provide a way to display the reports on certain users' left-hand project menu and thus are different from setting a user's user rights."

However, REDCap goes to great length to ensure that voice call records and SMS transcriptions do not stay in Twilio's logs but are removed shortly after being completed. This is done for security and privacy concerns (e.g., HIPAA), in which your survey participants' phone numbers and their survey responses do not get permanently logged on Twilio's servers but instead remain securely in REDCap."
survey_969 = "SETUP & CONFIGURATION: To use this feature, you must have a Twilio.com user account that is funded with some money (since there is a cost for each phone call made and for each SMS message sent). If you do not have a Twilio account, it is very easy to go to Twilio.com and create one. Once your REDCap project is connected to your Twilio account by entering your Twilio account credentials on your REDCap project's Project Setup page, you can then configure how you want to use Twilio in your project. In general, not much is different between administering a survey normally in REDCap than when using Twilio SMS/voice calls except that you additionally choose how your survey invitations are delivered. The following choices are available: 1) Initiate survey as voice call, 2) Initiate survey as SMS conversation, 3) Send survey invitation with survey link via SMS, 4) Send survey invitation via SMS to take survey as voice call (respondent makes call), 5) Send survey invitation via SMS to take survey as voice call (respondent receives call when replying via SMS).

Participants will respond by entering numbers on their phone's keypad, thus only numeric responses can be used because of this limitation (this includes the use of integer/number fields and also multiple choice questions with numeric codings, in which the participant will enter the numeric coded value on their keypad, not the label that is read to them over the phone).

This is not done by REDCap but is done internally by Twilio as you use its services. In this way, no monetary transactions are made by REDCap, and thus it is your responsiblity to maintain the funds in your Twilio account in order to ensure that the service continues to work for your REDCap project.

This might be used if somehow an invitation was scheduled by accident and you need to quickly delete it. NOTE: You must have checked the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox in order for the 'stop logic' to work. By having the checkbox checked, it means that every time a given record is saved or has data modified, REDCap will see if there is an invitation scheduled for this record/survey, and if so, it will then double check to see if this condition/logic is still true. If condition is no longer true, it will delete the invitation so that it never gets sent. And if the record is modified again later, in which the condition then becomes true again, then the invitation will get re-scheduled. Without the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox being checkbox, REDCap will leave the scheduled invitation as-is and never delete it."
survey_1260 = "The 'stop logic' could be a complex set of conditional logic, or it could be as simple as a single field in the project (i.e., the kill switch). For example, if you are wanting a survey invitation to be scheduled when a participant is at least 18 years old, your logic might be '[age] >= 18'. And if you want to add the 'stop logic' to be able to manually delete a scheduled invitation, you could have '[age] >= 18 and [remove_alert] <> 1', in which the field 'remove alert' is a Yes/No field. So in this instance, if you wanted to have the scheduled invitation deleted, you could simply go to the data entry form where the 'remove alert' field is located, and set it to 'Yes'. This can be done a variety of different ways. This is merely a simple example to introduce this concept. <b>Remember, the key to using 'stop logic' is that the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox MUST be checked.</b>"

(Note: This assumes that the user has already created their data collection instruments and fields in their project.) There are two types of fields that may be mapped: 1) one-time data fields, and 2) temporal data fields. One-time data fields are those where data will only be stored one time in the source system, such as demography data. Conversely, temporal data fields are those where data may be collected many times over a period of time (e.g., labs, vitals, any kind of longitudinal data). When mapping temporal fields, you must also specify a REDCap date/datetime field that will be used for determining the window of time in which it should look when fetching data from the source system. It will determine the window of time in conjunction with the day offset value defined on the mapping page. For example, if the value of the mapped REDCap date/datetime field is 2001-11-29 and the day offset is 1 day, it will query the source system and return only data saved for the field from 2001-11-28 until 2001-11-30. Any source data outside of that range will be ignored during the adjudication process. It is important to note that the source data for a temporal field will NOT be fetched from the external source system UNLESS its associated REDCap date/datetime field has a value. Once a value is entered for the associated date/datetime field, source data will then be fetched for that temporal field."
ws_46 = "Preview fields (optional)"

Preview fields are optional and are typically used to confirm that the record identifier (e.g. medical record number) that was entered is correct by displaying other contextual data from the source system. For example, if you have 'last name' and 'date of birth' as source fields, you may choose them to be preview fields in your project, and thus when a value is entered in REDCap as the record identifier, if will then fetch and display the last name and date of birth of the person to validate their identity.

This might be used if somehow an alert was scheduled by accident and you need to quickly delete it. NOTE: You must have checked the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox in order for the 'stop logic' to work. By having the checkbox checked, it means that every time a given record is saved or has data modified, REDCap will see if there is an alert scheduled for this record, and if so, it will then double check to see if this condition/logic is still true. If condition is no longer true, it will delete the notification so that it never gets sent. And if the record is modified again later, in which the condition then becomes true again, then the notification will get re-scheduled. Without the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox being checkbox, REDCap will leave the scheduled alert as-is and never delete it."
alerts_35 = "The 'stop logic' could be a complex set of conditional logic, or it could be as simple as a single field in the project (i.e., the kill switch). For example, if you are wanting to schedule an alert when a participant is at least 18 years old, your logic might be '[age] >= 18'. And if you want to add the 'stop logic' to be able to manually delete a scheduled alert, you could have '[age] >= 18 and [remove_alert] <> 1', in which the field 'remove alert' is a Yes/No field. So in this instance, if you wanted to have the scheduled alert deleted, you could simply go to the data entry form where the 'remove alert' field is located, and set it to 'Yes'. This can be done a variety of different ways. This is merely a simple example to introduce this concept. <b>Remember, the key to using 'stop logic' is that the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox MUST be checked.</b>"

These missing codes may be used to aid in data analysis by specifying why a field lacks a value.  To enable this feature below, enter both the codes AND their labels for all the categories of missing data that you wish to use in this project.  The missing codes should be coded just like the choices of a multiple choice field with <i>code + comma + label</i>, in which the codes  can only have letters, numbers, dots, dashes, and underscores (e.g., '-999, Not asked' or 'UNK, Unknown').  If no codes are entered, this feature will remain disabled."

Click the icon to open your list of missing data codes, and select one. Once selected, it will save the missing code as the literal  data value for the field. Missing data codes can be used for any field type (e.g., date, slider, file upload fields).  Since a missing data code is saved as the field value, this means that the field's missing data code can then be optionally exported in a data export or viewed in a report  (if you so choose - this is an option when creating a report). Entering a missing data code must be done manually by a user via the user interface or through  a data import (API or Data Import Tool), in which you may import the missing data codes as the fields' values in your data import file."

missing_data_15 = "Additional instructions and notes:"
missing_data_16 = "TIP: When defining your missing data codes, please keep in mind to make sure that your missing code will never clash/overlap with a real value on a field in your project.  For example, it you have an integer field where '-999' is a possible value, then you should not use -999 as a missing data code. This is because REDCap will not be able  to know if this is a real value or if it is a missing code used to denote that the field is blank. Below to the right are some optional suggestions for missing data  codes that you might consider using, but feel free to use whatever missing data codes that you wish."
missing_data_17 = "NOTE: Behavior with branching logic - If a field should be hidden by branching logic, REDCap will typically ask the user (except on surveys)  if they wish to delete the value of the field being hidden. But if the field has a missing data code saved for it, it will still hide the field but will  not remove the missing data code as the field’s value. This allows a field to still be “blank” and have a missing code while being hidden by branching logic."
missing_data_18 = "LOGIC: Because missing data codes are stored as the literal field values, they may be used and referenced in logic throughout REDCap  (i.e., logic for report filters, Data Quality rules, Survey Queue, Automated Survey Invitations, branching logic). For example, if you want to display a field on a form only  if the previous field is blank and is marked with the missing data code 'NASK', your branching logic might be the folowing: [field] = 'NASK'. Additionally, a special  function 'isblankormissingcode()' may be used in logic as a catch-all for determining if a field's value is truly blank or if it contains a missing data code.  E.g. isblankormissingcode([age]), in which if age has a value of UNK (which might be a missing data code in a project),  then it will return TRUE. And if the field has any non-blank/non-null value that is also not a missing data code, it will return FALSE."
missing_data_19 = "ACTION TAG: By default, the missing data code functionality is enabled for ALL fields in the project, but it can be disabled on a field-by-field basis by adding the action  tag @NOMISSING for an individual field, in which this will hide the 'M' icon for the field on the data entry form and thus prevent usage of the missing data codes for the field."
